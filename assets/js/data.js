Because it is effective in relieving symptoms in a short period of time it is quite popular. Psychodynamic work addresses the root cause of emotional difficulties. Psychodynamic therapy focuses on the experience of the client and seeks to understand and change a person's relationship to the world. Because psychodynamic work addresses the underlying issues, issues which may have developed over many years, it can take longer. Psychodynamic therapy can lead to deep and lasting change in one's outlook, emotions, and relationships.",
