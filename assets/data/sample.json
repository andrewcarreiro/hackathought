Let Paintlounge broaden your mindset – we want to take you back to the fun you had back in grade school before your day-to-day busyness took centre-stage. By simply playing around with colours and lines, you can express a whole range of emotions. And no drawing skills are needed!\n\nOur goal is to show you that social painting is fun, relaxing, and is actually beneficial (it’s like a creativity workout) for our everyday lives. No matter if you’re left-brained or right-brained, we believe that you’re at your best when you get to exercise both sides of your brain.\n\nThey have a cafe!",
